        <h3 id="c14">1.4 Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the future of the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic impacts for the District.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the question at this point is when government and self-imposed social distancing will ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            The April 2020 U.S. forecast from IHS Markit, which underpins the Arizona forecasts, assumes that social distancing begins to relax in the July-August period.
        </p>
        <p>
            The epidemiological uncertainties create economic uncertainties. We are on track for a significant downturn; the question is how wrong and for how long.
        </p>
        <p>
            This forecast update is a step in assessing the damage and the recovery. It projects a much more significant adverse shock to the state economy than even thirty days ago in March 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            As more hard data is released in the coming months, we will know more about the economic impacts and the prospects for recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            As more hard data is released in the coming months, we will know more about the economic impacts and the prospects for recovery. For the April U.S. and Arizona forecasts, the baseline projections are assigned a 45% probability; The pessimistic scenario has a 35% probability, and the optimistic scenario has a 20% probability.
        </p>

         <h3 id="c15">1.5 Arizona Outlook</h3>
        <p>
            The national forecast, summarized below, is combined with assumptions about the impact of industry shutdowns on employment and retail sales. Assuming massive employment reductions in leisure and hospitality and retail trade and significant closures in personal services and health care, during the second quarter of 2020, driven by the government and voluntary social distancing measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            To offer the <abbr title="comprehensive economic development strategy">CEDS</abbr> reader a sense of the estimated shutdown impact, employment in leisure and hospitality is assumed to drop from 335,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 91,000 in the second quarter of 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trade, transportation, and utility jobs drop from 546,000 in the last quarter of 2019 to 405,000 in the second quarter. Health care and social services jobs decline by 16,000 jobs as dentists, doctors, and physical therapists avoid non-emergency interactions with patients and clients. Personal services fall by 11,000 to reflect the shutdown by barbers, hair, and nail salons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taxable sales at retail establishments and restaurants and bars also experience a massive decline in the second quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current baseline projections put the magnitude of the coming downturn at about 50% higher than the 2008-2009 recession but shorter in duration. Under current assumptions, it is a quick, sharp shock.
        </p>
        <p>
            Total nonfarm employment in Arizona declines by 481,000 from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2020. That translates into a peak-to-trough decline of 16.2%. For comparison, Arizona lost 305,000 jobs from peak-to-trough (quarterly) during the <em>Great Recession</em>. That was an 11.45 drop.
        </p> 
        <p>
            On an annual average basis, the forecast calls for state jobs to drop by 10.2% this year from 2019. That falls below the peak-to-trough decline because the downturn begins and ends in 2020. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The state unemployment rate surges to 19.0% by the fourth quarter of 2020 but then drops rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taxable retail sales decline this year, as job, income, and wealth declines take a toll on consumers. Sales at restaurants and bars get hit harder, given the additional headwind from social distancing.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Population growth slows, with reduced net migration, and that generates lower levels of housing permit activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the economic shock settles this year, the recovery should be reliable. Arizona was in excellent shape before the outbreak, and once the outbreak is under control, growth will accelerate significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growth rates will look very good initially because we are restarting large sectors of the economy. The forecast calls for employment to return to its fourth-quarter 2019 level by the end of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pessimistic scenario assumes a deeper, more prolonged downturn. Arizona jobs decline by 695,000 from the last quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020. That translates into a 23.4% drop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The state unemployment rate peaks at 22.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, then gradually declines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the pessimistic scenario, it takes longer for the state to return to pre-outbreak levels. Jobs return to their late 2019 level in the first quarter of 2025, five years from now.
        </p>
        <h6><a href="ceds.html">Return to CEDS</a></h6>
        <h3 id="c16">1.6 National Outlook</h3>
        <p>
            IHS Markit now assumes that the rate of new coronavirus cases will be dwindling by this August, which implies that we will see the gradual lifting of government and voluntary quarantines begin around that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The forecast calls for a very severe economic downturn. It begins with a substantial 3.5% annualized real GDP declined in the first quarter of 2020, followed by a giant 26.5% drop in the second quarter. The recession concludes in the third quarter with a decline of 10.4%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unemployment rate rises to a peak of 10.3% by the end of 2020. The recovery's shape is expected to look like the Nike-swoosh: a large drop followed by a gradual improvement. Keep in mind that this refers to the level of economic activity. Rapid growth rates return quickly, but real GDP does not return to its previous peak until the third quarter of 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            The monetary policy response is assumed to be very accommodative, with the federal funds rate near zero for the foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <p>
            The federal fiscal policy response in the forecast includes the <abbr title="the coronavirus aid relief and economic security (CARES) act">CARES Act</abbr>. It cushions the blow modestly.
        </p>
        <p>
            IHS Markit has downgraded performance during the first three quarters of 2020. The peak-to-trough decline has been increased from 3.8% to 8.3%. For perspective, the peak-to-trough decline during the six quarter-long <em>Great Recession</em> was 4.0%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The April forecast calls for a 5.4% decline in real GDP on average in 2020, followed by a 6.3 increase in 2021. Thus, the significant reduction this year is followed by a strong rebound from shallow levels of activity. Keep in mind that the annual average decline is much less than the peak-to-trough drop because the downturn begins and ends in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            Real personal consumption expenditures drop by 5.5. this year and then recover with a 7.2% growth in 2021. The drop in household spending is driven by social distancing, the massive wealth decline as stock prices drop, and now job and income losses caused by government-imposed business closures. Consumer confidence suffers a significant setback.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some spending categories are hit harder than others, with travel and tourism-related sectors suffering the biggest hits. These sectors include transportation, entertainment, gambling, lodging, food away from home, and travel. Real consumer spending on accommodation and food services fall by between 61.0% and 62.0% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of this year. Recreation spending falls by 40.4%. Public transportation expenditures drop by 12.8%.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other significant components of consumer spending are affected, as well. In particular, light vehicles' unit sales are projected to decline by 40.2% from the last quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020.
