          <p>Analysis of Economic Development</p>
          <em>How do the region's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats serve as guideposts for charting a path to the future?</em>
          <h3 id="c61">6.1 Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            Isolation is not generally considered an economic asset. However, for some areas of the District, the relative isolation and substantial empty territory have been advantageous. There are getting to be fewer and fewer places where major power generation facilities can be sited without protest, or large military installations can be located without conflicting with other users. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The District’s communities have benefited from being able to provide locations for both types of development. The <a href="economic-clusters.html#c432">Yuma Proving Ground</a> and <a href="economic-clusters.html#c431">Marine Corps Air Station</a> are located near Yuma. They are an essential contributor to the Yuma County economy, providing over 8,000 jobs and more than $170 million in annual payroll. The District is also becoming a location for commercial power generation. Industrial power generators either already operating within the District include CalEnergy Generation in Yuma County and Griffith Energy in Mohave County. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Other energy-related projects have been proposed for District communities, including a proposed plant in La Paz County, for which development was stopped after all permitting, etc., was completed. The District has also provided sites for commercial testing grounds beside the Army’s Yuma Proving Ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the factors attracting such developments and installations to the District is the relative isolation of much of the District land from major urban centers and the mostly unpopulated areas in which such facilities can locate.

        <h3 id="c62">6.2 Problems & Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            Like most states, Arizona is recruiting new businesses and industries to develop its economy and fortify itself against future economic downturns. Arizona has traditionally relied upon population growth as its primary commercial driver — building the economy via construction, tourism, and retirement-related industries. However, the COVID-19 Pandemic, which began affecting Arizona in March 2020, dramatically curtailed population growth and tourism, devastating the housing market, reducing state revenues, driving up unemployment, and sending shock waves through all economic sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States as a whole has suffered from a prolonged recession and now, COVID-19 Pandemic, but Arizona’s economy took a disproportionately negative hit. Ideally, disasters like the Great Recession and COVID-19 Pandemic contain lessons. The lesson this time, while not new, is clear: Arizona’s historical reliance on growth has made the state too vulnerable to recessionary downturns — past, present, and future.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, local and state leaders have begun looking for ways to diversify Arizona’s economy. To that end, most cities and towns in Arizona and some counties and Arizona as a whole, have pursued economic development efforts to explore new industrial sectors, better utilize existing resources, attract new businesses, retain current industries and promote a more-skilled workforce. Facing a similar one-industry dilemma, Nevada two years ago commissioned the development of an economic, strategic plan and is moving forward with implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arizona has an uphill battle. The nation’s other 49 states are chasing the same dream and, in many cases, the same dollars. Global competition is fierce and growing. Arizona is merely one economy competing in a world of thousands. And most industries and businesses are understandably inclined to set up shop wherever circumstances are most favorable.
